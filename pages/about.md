# About

My name is Giancarlo Gerdo and I am a Cybersecurity Engineering student and pentesting lover. I enjoy doing research and sharing my knowledge with people around me. My purpose with this page is to share my experiences on various CTFs and machines made on platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe. As well as sharing information of interest through blogs. I'm open to any type of question or suggestion that you want to ask me. You can contact me through Twitter or via email.
